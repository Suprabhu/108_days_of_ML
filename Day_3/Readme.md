Multiple Linear Regression

Multiple Linear Regression is one of the important regression algorithms which models the linear relationship between a single dependent continuous variable and more than one independent variable.


Here : Y = b0 + b1 * x1 + b2 * x2 + b3 * x3 + …… bn * xn 
Y = Dependent variable and x1, x2, x3, …… xn = multiple independent variables

Multiple Linear Regression model has been implemented to study the impact of variables such as R&D Spend, Administration spend,	Marketing Spend and location of a stratup
on Profit.
