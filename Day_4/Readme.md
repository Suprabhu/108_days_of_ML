Polynomial Regression is a form of regression analysis in which the relationship between the independent variables and dependent variables are modeled in the nth degree polynomial.

Polynomial Regression is a special case of Linear Regression where we fit the polynomial equation on the data with a curvilinear relationship between the dependent and independent variables.
